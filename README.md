## Fusion AI

The Fusion AI feature leverages advanced machine learning models to provide intelligent responses based on user input. It utilizes the `callFusionModel` function to interact with the AI model, which processes the input and returns a relevant response. The implementation includes error handling and retry logic to ensure robust communication with the AI service.

### Key Features:
- **Asynchronous Communication**: The AI model is called asynchronously, allowing for a smooth user experience.
- **Error Handling**: The system retries requests in case of rate limits or other errors, ensuring reliability.
- **Response Validation**: The responses from the AI are validated to ensure they meet the expected structure.

## Translation Feature

The translation feature allows users to communicate in multiple languages. It uses the `translateText` function to translate user input into English before sending it to the AI model. The response from the AI can also be translated back into the user's selected language.

### Key Features:
- **Caching**: Translations are cached to improve performance and reduce API calls.
- **Language Selection**: Users can select their preferred language, enhancing accessibility and user experience.
- **Fallback Mechanism**: If translation fails, the original text is returned, ensuring that the user can still communicate effectively.
# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:


- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
